# odin-recipes

This is the first project in TOP (The Odin Project)

I'll be creating a webpage that include recipes using HTML only (no CSS yet)
Also, I'll be practicing git and how to use it's features (commit, push, etc...)

It's not going to be the best looking webpage but it's just for practicing certain topics.
